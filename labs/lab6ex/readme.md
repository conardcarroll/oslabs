#Lab 6
Really? I feel like you gave this one to us. Maybe I shouldn't have even changed the name of the files to match. It was driver-05 which fulfilled all the requirements of this lab. I changed the names to match your request, and a few tweaks to the load/unload files but other wise it was all good. (Insert witty statement about your computer getting hacked by a student phishing). When I app write it will output the entire buffer, which is just begging for a null sled but that's another conversation entirely. Thanks for the heads up about not submitting my labs yet.  Hope this convinces you.
